## Application Tracking System (ATS) using Generative AI

This project is a Streamlit-based application that leverages Google's generative AI API (Gemini) to process job applications. Users can upload their resumes in PDF format, enter a job title and description, and specify advanced criteria for matching.

The app utilizes PyPDF2 for PDF processing, dotenv for environment variables, and integrates with the Google generative AI API for keyword matching. The "prompts" folder contains text files with prompts for different job roles, facilitating a streamlined matching process. The app displays profile match percentages and other details, helping streamline the recruitment process for both candidates and recruiters.
